# ⚡ LeetCode Problem of the Day (POTD)

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my daily solutions to **LeetCode's Problem of the Day (POTD)**. I solve these problems to **sharpen my coding skills**, improve **problem-solving abilities**, and practice **data structures & algorithms** consistently.

Each day's problem is stored as a separate file with the format:
```
DAY_<day_number>_<problem_title>.*
```
